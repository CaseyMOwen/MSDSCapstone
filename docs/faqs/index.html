            <p>This site uses machine learning models based on data from the ResStock dataset, a dataset created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).</p>

        <button class="faq-accordion-button"><i class="fas fa-solid fa-angle-right arrow"></i> Where does the data come from?</button>
        <div class="faq-panel">
            <p>The dataset is the result of significant datagathering on the United States building stock. This is used to generate fictional buildings that match the real building stock as closely as possible. These generated buildings are then passed into EnergyPlus models to determine the energy output of each building, which is validated against the real data.</p>

            <p>As many as you know. This site was created to allow for users to still benefit even if they know only limited information, so simply leave blank anything you don't know.</p>
