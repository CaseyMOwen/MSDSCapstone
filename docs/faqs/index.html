        <div class="faq-panel">
            <p>This site uses machine learning models based on data from the ResStock dataset, a dataset created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).</p>
        </div>
        <button class="faq-accordion-button"><i class="fas fa-solid fa-angle-right arrow"></i> Where does the data come from?</button>
        <div class="faq-panel">
            <p>The dataset is the result of significant datagathering on the United States building stock. This is used to generate fictional buildings that match the real building stock as closely as possible. These generated buildings are then passed into EnergyPlus models to determine the energy output of each building, which is validated against the real data.</p>

        <button class="faq-accordion-button"><i class="fas fa-solid fa-angle-right arrow"></i> How many features should I enter?</button>
        <div class="faq-panel">
            <p>As many as you know. This site was created to allow for users to still benefit even if they know only limited information, so simply leave blank anything you don't know.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="faq-accordion-button"><i class="fas fa-solid fa-angle-right arrow"></i> Why are the error bars so large?</button>
        <div class="faq-panel">
            <p>The error bars on the charts represent the uncertainty in the caluclation - the more information you provide, the tighter these will be. The bars enclose the middle 50% of outcomes - the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile. Much of this uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in the other properties of your home. Even if you make every possible selection above, there is still a lot that these charts do not know about your home - what materials the walls are made out of, for example. The machine learning models themselves also have a degree of error, which adds additional uncertainty. </p>
